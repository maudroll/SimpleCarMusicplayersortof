Lets you search your favorite songs via voice on Youtube! 

However there are countless issues to fix or even things that should be added:

Short list of improvements:

  1. Since its gonna be used in a car, weather information could be useful
  2. Youtube script uses the first video that is on that list; Im not sure if selecting only songs/music videos is an option
  3. Keep in mind, it uses Google Speech Recognition -> limited to 50 words a day, however I have never encountered such an limit (in my testing)
  
  
  THE MOST IMPORTANT THING: I have tried to translate it into Java to run it on Android -> smaller bugs -> I will upload it soon
              If anybody has time to do it, please do it:
              Please tell me about
